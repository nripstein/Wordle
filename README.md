# Wordle
A colour-accurate command-line implementation of the addictive word-guessing game in Python.

## How to Play
1. Run the main.py file. Set the desired answer as an argument for the run_game() function
2. Enter a five-letter word as your guess.
3. The game will indicate which letters are correct and in the correct position (marked in green) and which letters are correct but in the wrong position (marked in yellow).
Keep guessing until you either win or run out of tries.
